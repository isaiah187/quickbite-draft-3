QuickBites Campus - Rebuilt site (responsive)
--------------------------------------------

This rebuild attempts to closely match your Canva site layout and content. It uses SVG placeholders in /assets folder (replace these with your Canva exported images to match exactly).

Files included:
- index.html
- menu.html
- contact.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- /assets/* (SVG placeholders)

How to use:
1. Replace assets/*.svg with your Canva images (same filenames or update img src paths).
2. Upload the full folder to a GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages (branch main, /root).
3. The site is responsive and should display nicely on mobile and desktop.

If you want, I can also attempt to fetch higher-resolution images from your Canva site, but that may require manual exporting from your Canva account for best quality.
